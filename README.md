# gradescale

I don't like grading scales that are based on 100%. It's easier for me to come up 
with an integer number of points for each assignment or task and sum them to arrive
at a total number of available points for the semester.

This program accepts that total number of points (an integer) and generates a markdown table
that shows how they equate to letter grades. It is based on FSU's grade scale.

While the original scale uses fractional numbers, the new scale uses integers.
